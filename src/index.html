  <h4>WHAT IT DOES</h4>
  <h2>An Enhanced Football Experience</h2>
  <p>The Guardian Live Scores app is your go to app for live scores and watching Premier League goals… Get in there,
    what a result!
    <br>
    As well as videos of all the goals, you can watch match highlights, check out the latest scores and results and
    stay bang-up-to-date with the big football stories from The Guardian publication.

  <h4>GET STARTED</h4>
  <h2>User-friendly Interface</h2>
  <p>The in-game goal clips from every Premier League match are available to Guardian TV customers with a Guardian
    subscription.
    <br>
    So, if you’re not a subscriber, now’s time to make that savvy call. If that’s a step too far for you, you
    can still watch loads of firecracker Premier League action as long as you sign in with a free Guardian iD.

        I use this app every day and it's a great way to keep up to date with what's going on in football. It's
        a shame it won't rotate into landscape mode like its main competitor

        Good for watching the goals and great for highlights instead of waiting till 10:30 before you can watch
        highlights on March of the day also no need of sky go
